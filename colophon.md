<p class="lead">How we build and maintain the DITA Open Toolkit project website.</p>

The DITA-OT project website is hosted via [GitHub pages][1] at [dita-ot.github.io][2], which redirects to [dita-ot.org][3].

The website is maintained in Git and updated by pushing commits to the repository at [github.com/dita-ot/dita-ot.github.io][4].

GitHub pages is powered by [Jekyll][5], a static website publishing engine. Source files for the project website are stored in [Markdown][6] and HTML, enriched with [Liquid][7] templating tags and styled with [Sass][8]. The [Bootstrap][9] framework provides the foundation for the site layout.

The [Documentation][10] section is maintained in DITA using the source files from the DITA Open Toolkit documentation repository at [github.com/dita-ot/docs][11]. The OT docs are transformed to HTML5 using the [org.dita-ot.html][12] plugin, which extends the default `html5` transformation with additional processing specific to the project website.

Site output is built with [Gradle][13] using the settings in the [site.gradle][14] build file. The [DITA Open Toolkit Gradle plugin][15] is used with the Gradle dæmon and the `--continuous` build option to automatically regenerate the site output whenever documentation source files change. A staging environment provides a preview of generated site output via the `jekyll serve` command for local testing.

[Travis CI][16] continuous integration automatically republishes the latest [development version][10] of the documentation on the project website whenever changes are pushed to the `develop` branch of the [dita-ot/docs][11] repository. The development docs are indexed by [Algolia DocSearch][17], which provides the full text search capabilities available via the search form in the navigation bar.

The page footers in the development documentation include **Edit this page** links that open the DITA source file for the topic in [oXygen XML Web Author][18]. The web-based authoring workflow prompts users to log in to GitHub and fork the [dita-ot/docs][11] repository if necessary. Changes saved in the authoring environment are committed to a new branch, and a pull request is created to submit changes for review by the DITA-OT documentation team.
