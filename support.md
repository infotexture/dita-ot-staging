With these limited resources, we can't offer direct support, but the DITA community offers several other forums, including:

- The [Yahoo! dita-users group][5] is the original DITA list-serv and a vital resource for the DITA community. People post regularly, both asking for and offering help. While the archived messages can be difficult to search, this is a treasure trove of information.
- The [DITA-OT Users Google Group][6] is a general interest DITA-OT product forum, for questions on any aspect of the toolkit â€” from installation and getting started to questions about specific overrides, plug-ins, and customizations.
- The StackOverflow developer community includes [topics related to DITA-OT][7].
- The [OASIS DITA Technical Committee][8] maintains the DITA standard.
